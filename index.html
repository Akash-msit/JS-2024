            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a 
              <a href="#" data-text="That means that code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluted, compiled and execute at runtime." class="info-model">dynamic, interpreted</a> and weakly typed programming
              language which was built with the purpose of runing in host
              enviroments (e.g. iside of a webpage browser)
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The
              programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written
              right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page
              loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t
              need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect,
              JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
